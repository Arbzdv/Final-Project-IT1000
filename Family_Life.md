### Friends

When I decided to go to Mizzou I chose it because only knew a couple people going in. My goal was to meet as many people as possible so I could have more fun than I did in highschool. So obviously as a male, the best way to meet a whole lot of new people was to join a fraternity. I joined [Delta Sigma Phi](https://www.deltasig.org/) and have no regrets and in fact i'd reccomend pledging to any of my friends. I matured, became a better man, and I became really close with my pledge brothers in my time when I lived in Delt Sig.

### Family 

My family is all from St. Charles Missouri, we live in the massive sea of suburbs that surround St. Louis. I have one older sibling Rachel. She moved out to LA this summer to persue a career in social work. She works in a school in a low income area with younger kids that are on the wrong path to try and get them back on track. She is going to get her masters degree soon as well. My Dad is a electrical enginner who works for Nidec Motor Corperation. Him and his team test the motors inside the robots that do most the work inside Amazon's massive fulfillment centers. My Mom is a Procuremnet Specialist for Meridian Medical Technologies, she buys the parts that make an EpiPen. We have a dog, Maya who is a huskey she doesn't do much other than run around and chew stuff up but she's adorable. She basically gets treated like a human so I'm adding her to the family section.
