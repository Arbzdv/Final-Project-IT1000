I am Alex Bohrer, I am an IT Major enrolled at the University of Missouri Columbia. In the future I want to be an IT consultant for a company. To prepare myself for this job I have taken and I'm enrolled  several courses that each focus on different coding languages to try and learn the way computers work. I also want to build a computer of my own to give myself experience with computer hardware.

## Examples of my work 
Here is where I will store side projects 

- Colorado Ski Trip Cost Estimator

- this was a recreational creation that I made to calculate how much my ski trip would cost if I bought new gear before the trip
