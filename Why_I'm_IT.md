# <h1 style="text-align:center;">My Story </h1> 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to my page all about my life and how it has taken a turn for the better. My name is Alex Bohrer and I am currently a student enrolled at The University Of Missouri Columbia and this is my story. I am majoring in Information Technology with a minor in Business. Originally I came to Mizzou to persue a degree in general business. I did this mainly because I wanted to find out what I was good at before specializing and potentially wasting money and time taking unessacry classes. After about a year and a half of business classes where I seemed to be learning no particular skill and knowing that I lack the unteachable skills like butter smooth charisma, and the want to dress business casual for the next 30 years, I had a calamity of purpose.  

### Nowadays:
- for every **10,000** college graduates *815* are likely to persue Business administration, this degree is persued by 31.2% of all business majors, makinging it is by far the most popular specialization within the business degree with the most competition **meaning you're not garenteed a job unless you are the best of the best**.

- for every **10,000** college graduates there are *315* degree-holders hoping to make it in marketing. 

- for every **10,000** college graduates there are *539*  degree-holders trying to receive a general business degree making it the *second most popular course of undergraduate study*.

### How I found IT
*"To me, work is not a job, To me, working is a purpose if it aint that then it's worthless"*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--** Big Sean**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I realized change was needed I looked in several other carrer fields to try and find the one path that would fill this lack of purpose. I knew that I wanted to help others so I first started looking toward nursing. After realizing how extremely competitive the MU Nursing program was, I continued searching for a meaningful career. I set my sights social work, my sisters major. I actually went and talked to an advisor about switching my major, but after I made my class schedule I got cold feet knowing that social work majors are severely underpaid and with looming college debt the last thing I want is to be a slave to college debt. I struggled for about a semester until my roommate and close friend Kyle told me about how the classes that I had already taken could apply toward Information Technology, Kyle's major. I had never really thought of working with computers as an option, but I had always had a interest in computers and I found it very satisfying spending time to find and fix problems with my computer as well as other peoples problems. After this my eyes were opened to the vast world of IT.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always enjoyed listening to podcasts, especially Joe Rogans podcast because of the wide range of interesting topics and guests he has on his show. I listened to one episode with the Presidential Cantidate Andrew Yang, and one of his main policies he is basing his campaign on is the looming danger of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The 4th Industrial Revolution refers to the coming innovations with computers and Artificial Intelligence that will soon replace millions of American's jobs. To be ahead of the curve, I switched to IT so when comouters and AI become more mainstream I can be the guy that comes in to fix the machine that would have replaced my job. Along with Andrew Yangs theory, IT happens to be one of the carrer fields that is in great demand, but in low supply so pay is excellent at the entry level.
