# <h1 style="text-align:center;">My Hobbies </h1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously being an IT major I have a niche with computers. Ever since I was little I have loved video games. The first game I ever played was a Tonka city builder game where you had the ability to create buildings with different materials like brick, steel, frame, etc... Flashforward fourteen years and I am still playing videogames, but by far my favorite is Rocket League. Who would've thought that flying-car soccer with rocket boosters would be so much fun!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a doubt my favoirte hobby is Skiing. My dad was an avid skiier all through his college years and so he decided to teach me when I was young so I could enjoy the effects of gravity on two slippery sticks in the freezing cold. Sadly here in Missouri the terrain and weather is not ecactly preferred for this alpine sport, but we make do with what we've got. There is a small resort near my hometown called [Hidden Valley](https://www.hiddenvalleyski.com/). It's not much but it is better than nothing at all. Recently I bought my first pair of skis and I am very excited to break them in this coming winter.
