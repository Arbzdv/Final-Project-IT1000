# <p style="text-align:center;">A Website All About Me </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;">By: **Alex Bohrer** </p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this website is to explore the possibilities of using markdown to create a website that is all about me and my professional life. My main goal in this project is to enhance my skills in web devloapment to prepare me for harder classes I will need to take. Also I want to use this as a way to post my personal coding projects so they are viewable and accessable to anyone who is interested.
